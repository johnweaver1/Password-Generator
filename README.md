# Password-Generator
## Description
This is a javascript program that creates a random password based on pre-made prompts that the user can pick. 

The prompts to choose are length (8-128 characters), uppercase, lowercase, special characters, and numbers.

The user will click on the generate button which prompts the user to select a number between 8-128. Once the number is selected they will be prompted if they want to use lowercase characters, uppercase characters, special characters, and numbers. Any combination is allowed. If the user makes a mistake they are alerted on what they need to do.
